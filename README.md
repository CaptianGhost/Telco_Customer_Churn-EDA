# Customer Churn Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a **Telco Customer Churn dataset** to understand customer behavior and identify factors that contribute to customer attrition.

The main goal of this project is to practice **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), business-driven insight generation** using a real-world business dataset.

## 🔍 Project Scope & Workflow

This project focuses on **understanding the data before modeling**, following a structured EDA approach:

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Loaded and inspected the dataset structure
- Identified data types, missing values, and inconsistencies
- Cleaned and prepared data for analysis without over-engineering unused columns

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed churn behavior across key business dimensions:
- Customer tenure
- Contract type
- Monthly charges
- Payment methods
- Senior citizen status

### 3️⃣ Visualization & Interpretation
- Visualized distributions and category comparisons
- Focused on clarity and interpretability rather than excessive plots
- Linked observed patterns to real-world business implications

## 📊 Key Insights
- **26.5%** of customers have churned, which implies a severe customer retention issue.
- The average tenure of customers who churn is decidedly shorter, implying that the critical phase when the customer might ‘**churn**’ occurs in the initial stages of customer life.
- The rate of churn is significantly higher for **Month-to-Month** than for any other form of contract. Long-term contracts confer better client retention.
- Customers who churn generally have **higher monthly charges**, which may indicate pricing or perceived value issues.
- People using **Electronic check** payments have been known to churn at a rate higher than those who use automatic payments.
- The churn rate for senior citizens is high compared to their overall number, which means that senior customers represent a vulnerable market segment.

## 🧠 Business Interpretation

The analysis suggests that churn is influenced by a combination of:
- Early customer experience
- Pricing and value perception
- Contract structure
- Payment convenience

Retention strategies should therefore focus on:
- Improving early-stage customer engagement
- Encouraging long-term contracts through incentives
- Reviewing pricing structures for high-risk customer segments
- Promoting automatic payment methods to reduce friction
