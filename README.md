# Customer Churn Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a **Telco Customer Churn dataset** to understand customer behavior and identify factors that contribute to customer attrition.

The main goal of this project is to practice **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation** using a real-world business dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
*Telco Customer Churn dataset* (Kaggle)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 What This Project Includes
- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing churn patterns based on:
  - Customer tenure
  - Contract type
  - Monthly charges
  - Payment methods
  - Senior citizen status
- Visualizing trends and distributions

## 📊 Key Insights
- **26.5%** of customers have churned, which implies a severe customer retention issue.
- The average tenure of customers who churn is decidedly shorter, implying that the critical phase when the customer might ‘**churn**’ occurs in the initial stages of customer life.
- The rate of churn is significantly higher for **Month-to-Month** than for any other form of contract. Long-term contracts confer better client retention.
- Customers who churn generally have **higher monthly charges**, which may indicate pricing or perceived value issues.
- People using **Electronic check** payments have been known to churn at a rate higher than those who use automatic payments.
- The churn rate for senior citizens is high compared to their overall number, which means that senior customers represent a vulnerable market segment.

## 📊 Skills Practiced
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Business-oriented data interpretation
- Data Visualization
- Extracting actionable insights from customer data
